Data Exploration:
Before analyzing the data, itâ€™s essential to understand its structure, characteristics, and potential issues. The following SQL queries were used to explore distinct values and check the data for consistency:

1. Check Distribution by Gender:
SELECT Gender, COUNT(Gender) AS TotalCount,
COUNT(Gender)*100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customer_Data) AS Percentage
FROM Customer_Data
GROUP BY Gender;

2. Check Distribution by Contract:
SELECT Contract, COUNT(Contract) AS TotalCount,
COUNT(Contract)*100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customer_Data) AS Percentage
FROM Customer_Data
GROUP BY Contract;

3. Check Customer Status & Revenue Distribution:
SELECT Customer_Status, COUNT(Customer_Status) AS TotalCount, SUM(Total_Revenue) AS TotalRev,
SUM(Total_Revenue) / (SELECT SUM(Total_Revenue) FROM Customer_Data) * 100 AS RevPercentage
FROM Customer_Data
GROUP BY Customer_Status;

4. Check Distribution by State:
SELECT State, COUNT(State) AS TotalCount,
COUNT(State)*100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customer_Data) AS Percentage
FROM Customer_Data
GROUP BY State
ORDER BY Percentage DESC;

5. Identify Unique Internet Types:
SELECT DISTINCT Internet_Type
FROM Customer_Data;

Null Value Exploration:
Identifying and handling missing or null values is crucial for maintaining data integrity. The following query helps in checking for null values across different columns:

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Customer_ID IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Customer_ID_Null_Count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Gender_Null_Count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Age_Null_Count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Married IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Married_Null_Count,
    -- Other columns here...
FROM Customer_Data;


Data Cleaning & Transformation:
To prepare the data for analysis, null values were replaced, and data was cleaned. The following SQL query was used to insert clean data into the production table:

SELECT 
    Customer_ID,
    Gender,
    Age,
    Married,
    State,
    Number_of_Referrals,
    Tenure_in_Months,
    ISNULL(Value_Deal, 'None') AS Value_Deal,
    Phone_Service,
    ISNULL(Multiple_Lines, 'No') As Multiple_Lines,
    Internet_Service,
    ISNULL(Internet_Type, 'None') AS Internet_Type,
    ISNULL(Online_Security, 'No') AS Online_Security,
    ISNULL(Online_Backup, 'No') AS Online_Backup,
    ISNULL(Device_Protection_Plan, 'No') AS Device_Protection_Plan,
    ISNULL(Premium_Support, 'No') AS Premium_Support,
    ISNULL(Streaming_TV, 'No') AS Streaming_TV,
    ISNULL(Streaming_Movies, 'No') AS Streaming_Movies,
    ISNULL(Streaming_Music, 'No') AS Streaming_Music,
    ISNULL(Unlimited_Data, 'No') AS Unlimited_Data,
    Contract,
    Paperless_Billing,
    Payment_Method,
    Monthly_Charge,
    Total_Charges,
    Total_Refunds,
    Total_Extra_Data_Charges,
    Total_Long_Distance_Charges,
    Total_Revenue,
    Customer_Status,
    ISNULL(Churn_Category, 'Others') AS Churn_Category,
    ISNULL(Churn_Reason , 'Others') AS Churn_Reason
INTO [db.Churn].[dbo].[prod_Churn]
FROM [db.Churn].[dbo].[Customer_Data];
View Creation:
Two views were created for further analysis in Power BI:

View for Churned & Stayed Customers:

CREATE VIEW vw_ChurnData AS
SELECT * FROM prod_Churn WHERE Customer_Status IN ('Churned', 'Stayed');
View for New Joiners:

CREATE VIEW vw_JoinData AS
SELECT * FROM prod_Churn WHERE Customer_Status = 'Joined';
